# Testing

[README.md](README.md)

[W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test site and ensure no errors were made.
When the website was run through the website 2 errors were found;
1.  The element “button” must not appear as a descendant of the “a” element - This was present throughout the pages on the website which have now been fixed. 
2.  Ilegal space used on “img” link to =src - One of the images on the gallery page had an extra space in the image link which has since been removed. 

## Client stories testing:

### Potentially new members;
Most common path - Home > Membership > Contact 
The home page provides enough information on what the gym has to offer. The last thing to check is the membership price to see if they can afford it. Each membership package has a call to action button which directs them to the contact us section to get a deeper understanding. 

### Existing members;
Most common path - Home > Classes
The home page provides general information that an existing member may need i.e opening times, facilities and location. The class timetables is also important information that an existing member would be looking for on the website.

The gallery page isn’t included in the common paths for the website but is still needed to showcase the great features to potential new members.
